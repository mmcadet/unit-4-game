The Crystals Collector Game

    * This is a numbers guessing game. 
    * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the bottom of the page.
    * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
    * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
    * This game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
    * When they do click one, the player's score counter will go up accordingly.
    * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
    * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
    * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
    * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

Game  notes:
* The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
* Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
